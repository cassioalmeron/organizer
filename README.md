# Organizer

The goal of this project is to showcase my background in Javascript/Typescript with NodeJS and ReactJS
This project is running in production at http://organizer.42web.io

##### The problem
We have many documents already stored in our One Drive and Google Drive accounts. But when we need to find someone, we need to dig through the folders.

##### Solution Proposal
A simple way to organize, classify and search those files.
